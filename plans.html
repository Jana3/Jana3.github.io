        <h2>Welcome to Games Afterglow!</h2>
        <h4>I have created this site to have a home for myself and for those creations, which I produce during my journey in game design.</h4>
        <p>January 2020. One night I was in a middle of a longer chitchat, when the idea hit me very hard: I should try to design a game. I've never done this before but I knew I could have a shot. Since my childhood I had a very strong bond to games. I've played a lot with my parent and my friends and I'm totally convinced that playing interesting and well-designed games helps you to improve your logical skill and rationality. I always admired the clever mechanics and interesting choices a game can offer during the gameplay. I wanted to be on the otherside and check if I would like the journey or not.</p>
        <p>So here we are, I'm working on this site from scratch, created the system for myself. Working on different prototypes for my early games. I want to push myself to have two or tree working prototypes to pitch at the end of 2020. I'm sure, my first games will be available for free here, on the website. These PnP games are here to make lots of hours joyful for as many fellow gamers as possible. These games are here to spend evenings together.</p>
